# WHALE SWIMS OFF THE BOTTLES

## FROST HACKS 2021

## INSPIRATION

Inspired from car racing games

## PROJECT

This project is about how a whale from the ocean reaches her destiny while overcoming all the hurdles it comes across be it from water transports or the plastic bottles that are present in the ocean. This game is kind of a way to create awareness of not dumping water bodies with plastic and related stuffs. So here game get over when it gets hit by any plastic or transport. Embark on this journey of supporting this cause by guiding a whale in proper path.

## HOW IT'S BUILT

This game is been built using complete python. We had added various python files to interact with the functionalities provided in this game like checking up with collisions, interacting with whale, adding up the object classes for all the features and main file which drives the project in an interactive manner.

## CHALLENGES FACED

The main challenge was making whale detect the collision and halting the game. Tried with many statements and loops to demo if that works. Second thing was interacting with whale as classes defined were not at all interacting and showing up the actions appropriately to the functions written. I was skeptical if the game would show up as final outcome with less time on grabs.

## ACCOMPLISHED

Atlast I pulled this off in a right time along with live demo to show the usage. Being unwell and working solo, I never expected of the positive outcome just from an imagination I had got up in my mind. It's so exciting that I had built up my own game out of my thoughts. I was always fascinate about water mammals like dolphins and whales etc. Initially thought of configuring dolphins but didn't find exact image of it.

## WHAT I HAD LEARNT

I had learnt creating independent files and merging them together using functions and classes provided for functionalities. Also to make it more realistic experience, I now know how to deal with images and define relevant classes. You can see I had added up bubbles class. 

## FUTURE OF WHALE SWIMS OFF THE BOTTLES

Next to this project would be to add a power up option to boost the whale in medium intervals when its hit by the collision just like it's in mario game, so that it stays alive and reaches the desting successfully. This would for sure motivate gamers on thriving hard to reach their goals.
